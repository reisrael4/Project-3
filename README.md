# Swanson Pyramid of Greatness
A pyramid that when clicked opens a modal that displays a Ron Swanson quote retrieved from the Ron Swanson Quotes API. Additionally you can search the quotes by topic and the modal will display one quote about that topic. I used HTML and CSS to build the website and JavaScript to build the interactivity.
